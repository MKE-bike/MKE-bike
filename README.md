Every* bike lane & trail in Milwaukee mapped

*Nearly

Here's almost every bike-friendly-ish surface in Milwaukee. I've been working on this for awhile, struggling with how to introduce it. For anyone looking to exercise the cabin fever away with hopefully fewer cars, please ride safely, disinfect your doorknobs, and wash your hands! Would you believe the City's own maps haven't been updated in a decade (2011[!!](https://city.milwaukee.gov/Milwaukee-by-Bike/maps.htm#.XjyFSjNKiM8)), the [City's 2010 master bike plan PDF has NO maps in its Maps chapter(!)](https://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cityBikePed/MilwaukeebyBike2010-Plan.pdf), Google Maps' Bicycling layer has tons of errors and omissions in Milwaukee, Strava sucks for commuters, and you can still social distance on a bike? Also, all of Seinfeld is on Hulu.

**tldr:** one bike map to rule them all, desktop and mobile friendly, and in the darkness bind all them other bad maps to Hell. 

**About this map:**  
Layers of lanes and trails are in the top right corner. Street segments are clickable for more details. This map maps all types of on-street bike lanes and paved off-street trails. Unlike most bike maps, this one does not include *bicycle routes*, which are only marked with small, vague signs in unnoticeable places, and on bad bike maps. *Bike routes* are usually connectors between lanes and/or trails, easily intuited or completely unintuitive. Plus, when bike maps *do* show bike routes, the maps can be crazy confusing - looking at you, [City of Milwaukee](https://city.milwaukee.gov/Milwaukee-by-Bike/maps.htm#.XjyFSjNKiM8). For that matter, bike maps can be absurdly complex, like [this angel hair pasta catastrophe from Brookfield](https://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/DocumentCenter/View/1362/pedestrian_bike_path_map?bidId=). Anyway:

**Solid green lines** are on-street paved bike lanes, including:  

* dedicated bike lanes are the most common (a lane with 1-2 parallel lines between moving traffic and curb, sometimes with green paint but usually not)

* buffered bike lanes (zebra stripes separating automotive vehicular traffic from dedicated bike lanes)  

* protected (by a barrier, duh)

* Milwaukee also has bidirectional [cycle tracks](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/cycle-tracks/raised-cycle-tracks/), raised and unraised, and Tosa has a bunch of [green bike boxes]
(https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/intersection-treatments/bike-boxes/)

* Milwaukee also has a few raised dedicated lanes, like on Bay St in Bay View, but since they're dedicated lanes that are kind of buffered but also kind of protected, I haven't marked them specially

If you're biking anywhere, prioritize the off-street trails, like the Oaf Leaf lines. If you're biking on streets, any street with solid green lines (on this map) are your best bets. Prioritize cycle tracks (like Mayfair between Bluemound & the Hank Aaron/I-94), over concrete divider-protected lanes, over buffered lanes, over dedicated lanes. Safety first.

**Fluorescent yellow-green lines** (will be dotted in the future) are used for shared bike lanes:

* Shared driving/biking lanes are marked on-street painted sharrows, which are [symbols of a bicyclist with two chevrons](https://www.bicycling.com/news/a20044419/what-are-sharrows-used-for/). Sharrows indicate that moving motor vehicles and bikes must share the same lane, and bikes have a clearer right-of-way. Sharrows sometimes but do not always mark official bike routes, but not all bike routes have sharrows. Bike routes and sharrows suck. Paint doesn't save lives.

* Shared parking lanes, aka Curb Lanes, are indicated by a curbside sign of a black and white diamond that may or may not also be painted on-street; bicyclists must share the lane with parked cars, and you might as well volunteer to get doored. Both are much less helpful than on-street lanes and off-street trails, but we'll take what we can get.

The City's Most Likely to Get You Doored awards probably go to all of North Ave, N 16th and 17th near Marquette, Prospect & Farwell, all of Brady, and Erie St in the Third Ward. I don't know if the width from parked car mirrors to lane line is a full 1.5m, but I'm probably not going to be the one to measure them.

**Other colors** are off-street, paved bike trails, except the [Oak Leaf Trail system](https://county.milwaukee.gov/County-Files/Parks-Department/Photo-Gallery/Explore/Trails/OLT-System-map-0619.pdf)'s so called *lines* ("Zip Line," "South Shore Line," etc.) are color-matched to the County Parks' map. But because we're so lucky to have so, so many off-street paved bike trails in Milwaukee County, I kind of ran out of colors to label them all. I welcome any feedback from those with visual impairments or map colorists so we can find some better colorways for these layers than hues like ochre, puke, etc.

Fellow pedants of all kinds, I'm sure you'll let me know which streets are missing or wrong. ;)

Call **Milwaukee's 311 equivalent 414-286-2489** to report cars in bike lanes, obstructions in bike lanes, etc.

Question: in keeping with the safety-first spirit of this map, should it include parkways? For instance, the OLT Kinnickinnic Line from 20th St west to McCarty Park, through Jackson Park and the Kinnickinnic River Parkway. If it materializes, it would really fill out the southside and connect the OLT KK River Line and non-OLT KK River Trail, a merger rumored for [maybe roughly 2022](https://www.railstotrails.org/trailblog/2015/january/13/wisconsins-kinnickinnic-river-trail/). Anyway, parkways themselves are not usually marked for cyclists with on-street paint markings, and signs are often inconsistent. If this map were to include parkways, routes/layers such as the Menomonee River Line and Root River Line would be filled out, their segments connected. Unfortunately, due to a bug, I can't yet use dotted lines (of the same color) that would otherwise stand for sharrows, shared lanes, curb lanes, *and parkways*.

Question: Can anyone account for any actual bike lanes with on-street paint or curb signs along Lake Drive in Shorewood (Capitol to Glendale Ave) or Whitefish Bay (Glendale to Silver Spring)? I had someone tell me there are, from Edgewood Ave north, but they only appear to be an extra-wide, unmarked shoulder. I'm hesitant to map these parts of Lake Dr until it unambiguously has even the barest minimum bike infrastructure - like every map of proposed bike infrastructure the City has ever made. I can't believe it's taking so long to do away with those ridiculous you-can-park-here-sometimes-and-drive-here-most-times lanes in this city (cough S 35th St), they're fucking dangerous for everyone, and I hate them.

A few observations on the state of bikeable Milwaukee: 

Holy crow, City, you have some work to do. Streets that would benefit from bike lanes & traffic calming:  
* westbound/eastbound streets: protected or buffered lanes for National, Mitchell, Burnham, Beloit?, Burleigh, Capitol - and definitely Oklafreakinghoma and Brady!  
* crucial northbound/southbound: Jersey barrier protected lanes or a bidirectional cycle track like Mayfair's, or even how about some marsupial bridges for South 27th, South 35th, and/or South 43rd?  
* Meanwhile we're still waiting for a reliable & safe north-south routes - Why hasn't Van Buren of all streets gone the route of Kilbourn with parking protected lanes? Or, I can't think of a better candidate for traffic calming + curb-protected bike lanes and intersection bump-outs. Biking - even just crossing on foot - on VB is dangerous af and the need for Jersey barriers is visceral. How bout Jeff & Jack? Maryland? Another bridge between Third Ward & Walker's Point? The list goes on... Though you'd think that a city (MKE) with such an affinity for its sibling Pittsburgh, would take a hint from PBG and get some more dang bridges, but I digress.

Bike lanes in Milwaukee seem to exist in most cases for traffic calming or road dieting, rather than actually helping people get around or commute. Milwaukee would really benefit from adopting a more progressive stance on bike infrastructure: more bike lanes and road dieting in the right ways and places could ideally result in less reckless driving, fewer deaths and maulings by cars, more bike commuters, and less traffic/vehicle volume on the streets. Cars are cholesterol to city streets; we're not IN traffic, we ARE traffic. Sounds like diet and exercise are the prescriptions in both cases.

Nearly 40,000 Americans *alone* die every year from cars. Paging/plugging the [The War on Cars](www.thewaroncars.org). I love driving and cars, but I love alive and healthy people more, and you should too.

Oh and check this shit out: all ~~roads~~ bike trails in ~~Rome~~ Milwaukee seem to lead to...the Couture. Gee.
