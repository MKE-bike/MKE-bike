Nearly every bike lane &amp; in Milwaukee mapped

For your preseason consideration, almost every bike-friendly-ish surface in Milwaukee. Why did I do this? What can I say - the City's own maps haven't been updated in a decade (2011!!), while very infomative the [City's 2010 master bike plan PDF has NO maps in its Maps chapter(!)](https://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cityBikePed/MilwaukeebyBike2010-Plan.pdf), Google Maps' Bike layer has tons of errors and omissions in Milwaukee, Strava sucks for commuters, the weather turnt, hibernation, beer, all of Seinfeld is on Hulu... 

**tldr:** one bike map to rule them all, desktop and mobile friendly, and in the darkness bind all them other bad maps. 

Layers of lanes and trails are in the top right corner. Street segments are clickable for more details. This map maps all types of on-street bike lanes and paved off-street trails. Unlike most bike maps, this one does not include *bicycle routes*, which are only marked with small, vague signs in unnoticeable places, and on bad maps. Bike routes are usually connectors between lanes and/or trails, and easily intuited. Plus, when bike maps do show bike routes, the maps are crazy busy - looking at you, [City of Milwaukee](https://city.milwaukee.gov/Milwaukee-by-Bike/maps.htm#.XjyFSjNKiM8). For that matter, bike maps can be absurdly complex, like [this angel hair pasta catastrophe from Brookfield](https://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/DocumentCenter/View/1362/pedestrian_bike_path_map?bidId=). Anyway:

Solid green lines are on-street, paved bike lanes including:  

* dedicated bike lanes are the most common (a lane with 1-2 parallel lines between moving traffic and curb, sometimes green but usually not)

* buffered bike lanes (zebra stripes between dedicated lane and vehicular traffic)  

* protected (by a barrier, duh)

* Milwaukee also has bidirectional [cycle tracks](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/cycle-tracks/raised-cycle-tracks/), raised and unraised, and Tosa has a bunch of [green bike boxes]
(https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/intersection-treatments/bike-boxes/)

If you're biking on streets, any street with solid green lines (on this map) are your best bets. Prioritize cycle tracks (like Mayfair between Bluemound & the Hank Aaron/I-94, or the rumored 2020 Chase Ave cycle tracks), over concrete divider-protected lanes, over buffered lanes, over dedicated lanes. Safety first.

Fluorescent yellow-green lines (will be dotted in the future) are used for shared bike lanes

* Shared driving/biking lanes are marked on-street painted sharrows, which are [symbols of a bicyclist with two chevrons](https://www.bicycling.com/news/a20044419/what-are-sharrows-used-for/). Not all bike routes have sharrows; sharrows do not always mark an official bike route. Sharrows indicate that moving vehicles must share the same lane and bikes have a clearer right-of-way.

* Shared parking lanes, aka Curb Lanes, are indicated by a curbside sign of a black and white diamond that may or may not also be painted on-street; bicyclists must share the lane with parked cars, and you might as well volunteer to get doored. Both are much less helpful than on-street lanes and off-street trails, but we'll take what we can get.

The City's Most Likely to Get You Doored awards probably go to all of North Ave, N 16th and 17th near Marquette, and Erie St in the Third Ward. I don't know if the width from parked car mirrors to lane line is a full 1.5m, but I'm probably not going to be the one to measure them.

Other colors are off-street, paved bike trails, except the [Oak Leaf Trail system](https://county.milwaukee.gov/County-Files/Parks-Department/Photo-Gallery/Explore/Trails/OLT-System-map-0619.pdf)'s so called *lines* ("Zip Line," "South Shore Line," etc.) are color-matched to the County Parks' map. But because we're so lucky to have so, so many off-street paved bike trails in Milwaukee County, I kind of ran out of colors to label them all. I welcome any feedback from those with visual impairments or map colorists so we can find some better colorways for these layers than ochre, puke, etc.

Question: in keeping with the safety-first spirit of this map, should it include parkways? The OLT Kinnickinnic Line from 20th St west to McCarty Park, through Jackson Park and the Kinnickinnic River Parkway, but it's the only parkway I've mapped so far. Parkways are not usually marked for cyclists with on-street paint markings, and signs are often inconsistent. If this map were to include parkways, routes/layers such as the Menomonee and Root River Lines would be filled out, their segments connected. Unfortunately, due to a bug, I can't yet use dotted lines (of the same color) that would otherwise stand for sharrows, shared lanes, curb lanes, *and parkways*.

Fellow pedants of all kinds, I'm sure you'll let me know which streets are missing. ;)

Ride safely! *Be seen*!

A few observations on the state of bikeable Milwaukee: 

Holy crow, City, you have some work to do. A better bikeable Milwaukee needs:
-Buffered or protected lanes for east & westbound streets National, Mitchell or Burnham, maybe Beloit? - and definitely Oklafreakinghoma.
-Buffered or protected lanes for crucial north & southbound travel on or along South 27th, South 35th, and/or South 43rd. Best bet would be Jersey barriers for a bidirectional cycle track.
-Meanwhile we're still waiting for a reliable & safe Eastside north-south route (Van Buren? Jeff & Jack?), another Third Ward to Walker's Point bridge, the list goes on... Though you'd think that a city (MKE) with such an affinity for its sibling Pittsburgh, would take a hint from PBG and get some more dang bridges, but I digress.

Bike lanes in Milwaukee seem to exist in most cases for traffic calming or road dieting, rather than actually helping people get around or commute. Like who besides me once ever blue moon would willing ride their bike on Forest Home? Milwaukee would really benefit from adopting a more progressive stance on bike infrastructure: more bike lanes and road dieting in the right ways and places could ideally result in less reckless driving, more bike commuters, and less traffic/vehicle volume on the streets. Cars are cholesterol to city streets; we're not IN traffic, we ARE traffic. Sounds like diet and exercise are the prescriptions in both cases.

Oh and check this shit out: all ~~roads~~ bike trails in Milwaukee seem to lead to...the Couture. Gee.

Know your laws: 
post both laws + map solo to miltownbiking then x-post both to mke as parent-child

Know your laws:

Thankfully WI is among the many states that require 3 feet - https://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/safely-passing-bicyclists.aspx but shoutout to Pennsylvania at 4 feet! Not like drivers care, I'm sure. https://www.bikeleague.org/StateBikeLaws

Use of sidewalks: 346.94(1): Driving on sidewalk. Except as authorized in s. 23.33 (4) (f) or when the sidewalk is an all-terrain vehicle route, as defined in s. 23.33 (1) (c) or an off-highway motorcycle route, as defined in s. 23.335 (1) (u), the operator of a vehicle may not drive upon any sidewalk area except at a permanent or temporarily established driveway unless permitted to do so by the local authorities.
