Milwaukee's Bike Lanes &amp; Trails

What can I say, the City's own maps haven't been updated in a decade, Google Maps sucks for this, Strava sucks for commuting, the weather turnt, I had the time, hibernation, beer, all of Seinfeld is on Hulu... 

What you should know:

Unlike most bike maps, this one does not include bicycle routes, which are unmarked on streets other than small, vague street signs in unnoticeable places. Bike routes are usually connectors between lanes and/or trails. They aren't marked on-street, but with signs which aren't readily visible. Plus bike maps with bike routes included are maps that look crazy busy - looking at you, City of Milwaukee. For that matter, bike maps can be absurdly complex, like this catastrophe from Brookfield. Anyway:

Solid green lines are on-street, paved bike lanes including: dedicated bike lanes (1-2 bicycle-designated parallel lines between traffic and curb), buffered bike lanes (zebra stripes between dedicated lane and vehicular traffic), or protected (by a barrier, duh).

Fluorescent yellow-green lines (will be dotted in the future) are used for shared bike lanes. Shared lanes are marked with on-street painted sharrows, symbols of a bicyclist with two chevrons. Sharrows indicate that moving vehicles must share the same lane and bikes have a clearer right-of-way. Shared parking lanes, aka Curb Lanes, are indicated by a curbside sign of a black and white diamond that may or may not also be painted on-street; bicyclists must share the lane with parked cars, and you might as well get doored. Both are much less helpful than on-street lanes and off-street trails, but we'll take what we can get. The City's Most Likely to Get You Doored awards probably go to all of North Ave, N 16th and 17th near Marquette, and Erie St in the Third Ward. I don't know if the width from parked car mirrors to lane line is a full 1.5m, but I'm probably not going to be the one to measure them.  https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/bike-lanes/conventional-bike-lanes/  https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/PED_BIKE/univcourse/pdf/swless19.pdf

Other random colors are off-street, paved bike trails except those colors which match the [Oak Leaf Trail system](https://county.milwaukee.gov/County-Files/Parks-Department/Photo-Gallery/Explore/Trails/OLT-System-map-0619.pdf)'s so called lines, such as the Zip Line or South Shore Line. The OLT network is color-matched to the County Parks' map. But because we're so lucky to have so, so many off-street paved bike trails in Milwaukee County, I kind of ran out of colors to label them all. I welcome any feedback from those with visual impairments or map colorists to find us some better colorways.

Question: in keeping with the spirit of safety-first, should this map include parkways? E.g. most of the current layer OLT Kinnickinnic Line from 20th west to McCarty Park. Parkways are not usually marked on-street with paint; signs are inconsistent. If this map were to include parkways, routes/layers such as the Menomonee and Root River Lines would be filled out, their segments connected. Unfortunately, due to a bug, I can't yet use dotted lines (of the same color) that would otherwise stand for sharrows, shared lanes, and parkways.
A few observations on the state of bikeable Milwaukee: holy crow, City, you have some work to do. Buffering lanes down the length of National, Mitchell or Burnham, maybe Beloit? - and definitely Oklafreakinghoma. West Milwaukee has an opportunity to connect Greenfield Ave, and meanwhile we're still waiting for a reliable, safe Eastside north-south route...

Fellow pedants of all kinds, I'm sure you'll let me know which pieces are missing ;)

Ride safely! Be seen!

Thankfully WI is among the many states that require 3 feet - https://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/safely-passing-bicyclists.aspx but shoutout to Pennsylvania at 4 feet! Not like drivers care, I'm sure. https://www.bikeleague.org/StateBikeLaws
