# MKE-bike
Every* bike lane & trail in Milwaukee mapped

*Nearly

For your preseason consideration, almost every bike-friendly-ish surface in Milwaukee. Why did I do this? What can I say - the City's own maps haven't been updated in a decade (2011[!!](https://city.milwaukee.gov/Milwaukee-by-Bike/maps.htm#.XjyFSjNKiM8)), the [City's 2010 master bike plan PDF has NO maps in its Maps chapter(!)](https://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cityBikePed/MilwaukeebyBike2010-Plan.pdf), Google Maps' Bicycling layer has tons of errors and omissions in Milwaukee, Strava sucks for commuters, the fall weather turnt, hibernation, beer, all of Seinfeld is on Hulu... 

**tldr:** one bike map to rule them all, desktop and mobile friendly, and in the darkness bind all them other bad maps to Hell. 

Layers of lanes and trails are in the top right corner. Street segments are clickable for more details. This map maps all types of on-street bike lanes and paved off-street trails. Unlike most bike maps, this one does not include *bicycle routes*, which are only marked with small, vague signs in unnoticeable places, and on bad bike maps. *Bike routes* are usually connectors between lanes and/or trails, easily intuited or completely unintuitive. Plus, when bike maps *do* show bike routes, the maps can be crazy confusing - looking at you, [City of Milwaukee](https://city.milwaukee.gov/Milwaukee-by-Bike/maps.htm#.XjyFSjNKiM8). For that matter, bike maps can be absurdly complex, like [this angel hair pasta catastrophe from Brookfield](https://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/DocumentCenter/View/1362/pedestrian_bike_path_map?bidId=). Anyway:

Solid green lines are on-street paved bike lanes, including:  

* dedicated bike lanes are the most common (a lane with 1-2 parallel lines between moving traffic and curb, sometimes with green paint but usually not)

* buffered bike lanes (zebra stripes separating automotive vehicular traffic from dedicated bike lanes)  

* protected (by a barrier, duh)

* Milwaukee also has bidirectional [cycle tracks](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/cycle-tracks/raised-cycle-tracks/), raised and unraised, and Tosa has a bunch of [green bike boxes]
(https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/intersection-treatments/bike-boxes/)

* Milwaukee also has a few raised dedicated lanes, like on Bay St in Bay View, but since they're dedicated lanes that are kind of buffered but also kind of protected, I haven't marked them specially

If you're biking anywhere, prioritize the off-street trails, like the Oaf Leaf lines. If you're biking on streets, any street with solid green lines (on this map) are your best bets. Prioritize cycle tracks (like Mayfair between Bluemound & the Hank Aaron/I-94, or the rumored 2020 Chase Ave cycle tracks), over concrete divider-protected lanes, over buffered lanes, over dedicated lanes. Safety first.

Fluorescent yellow-green lines (will be dotted in the future) are used for shared bike lanes:

* Shared driving/biking lanes are marked on-street painted sharrows, which are [symbols of a bicyclist with two chevrons](https://www.bicycling.com/news/a20044419/what-are-sharrows-used-for/). Sharrows indicate that moving motor vehicles and bikes must share the same lane, and bikes have a clearer right-of-way. Sharrows sometimes but do not always mark official bike routes, but not all bike routes have sharrows. Bike routes and sharrows suck. Paint doesn't save lives.

* Shared parking lanes, aka Curb Lanes, are indicated by a curbside sign of a black and white diamond that may or may not also be painted on-street; bicyclists must share the lane with parked cars, and you might as well volunteer to get doored. Both are much less helpful than on-street lanes and off-street trails, but we'll take what we can get.

The City's Most Likely to Get You Doored awards probably go to all of North Ave, N 16th and 17th near Marquette, Prospect & Farwell, all of Brady, and Erie St in the Third Ward. I don't know if the width from parked car mirrors to lane line is a full 1.5m, but I'm probably not going to be the one to measure them.

Other colors are off-street, paved bike trails, except the [Oak Leaf Trail system](https://county.milwaukee.gov/County-Files/Parks-Department/Photo-Gallery/Explore/Trails/OLT-System-map-0619.pdf)'s so called *lines* ("Zip Line," "South Shore Line," etc.) are color-matched to the County Parks' map. But because we're so lucky to have so, so many off-street paved bike trails in Milwaukee County, I kind of ran out of colors to label them all. I welcome any feedback from those with visual impairments or map colorists so we can find some better colorways for these layers than ochre, puke, etc.

Fellow pedants of all kinds, I'm sure you'll let me know which streets are missing. ;)

Bicyclists, call 414-286-2489 to report cars in bike lanes, obstructions in bike lanes, etc.

Question: in keeping with the safety-first spirit of this map, should it include parkways? The OLT Kinnickinnic Line from 20th St west to McCarty Park, through Jackson Park and the Kinnickinnic River Parkway, but it's the only parkway I've mapped so far because it kind of fills out the southside and I wanted to envision what the complete OLT KK River Line and KK River Trail merger would look like in [maybe roughly 2022](https://www.railstotrails.org/trailblog/2015/january/13/wisconsins-kinnickinnic-river-trail/). Anyway, parkways are not usually marked for cyclists with on-street paint markings, and signs are often inconsistent. If this map were to include parkways, routes/layers such as the Menomonee and Root River Lines would be filled out, their segments connected. Unfortunately, due to a bug, I can't yet use dotted lines (of the same color) that would otherwise stand for sharrows, shared lanes, curb lanes, *and parkways*.

Question: Can anyone account for any *actual, legitimate* bike lanes with on-street paint or curb signs along Lake Drive in Shorewood (Capitol to Glendale Ave) or Whitefish Bay (Glendale to Silver Spring)? I had someone tell me there are, from Edgewood Ave north, but they only appear to be shared sometimes-parking lanes or an unmarked shoulder. I'm hesitant to map any park of Lake Dr until it unambiguously has explicit bike infrastructure - as every map of proposed bike infrastructure the City has ever put out. I can't believe it's taking so long to do away with those ridiculous you-can-park-here-sometimes-and-drive-here-most-times lanes in this city, they're fucking dangerous for everyone, and I hate them.

A few observations on the state of bikeable Milwaukee: 

Holy crow, City, you have some work to do. A better bikeable Milwaukee needs:
-Buffered or protected lanes for east & westbound streets National, Mitchell or Burnham, maybe Beloit? - and definitely Oklafreakinghoma.
-Buffered or protected lanes for crucial north & southbound travel on or along South 27th, South 35th, and/or South 43rd. Best bet would be Jersey barriers for a bidirectional cycle track.
-Meanwhile we're still waiting for a reliable & safe Eastside north-south route (Van Buren? Jeff & Jack?), another Third Ward to Walker's Point bridge, the list goes on... Though you'd think that a city (MKE) with such an affinity for its sibling Pittsburgh, would take a hint from PBG and get some more dang bridges, but I digress.

Bike lanes in Milwaukee seem to exist in most cases for traffic calming or road dieting, rather than actually helping people get around or commute. Like who besides me once ever blue moon would willing ride their bike on Forest Home? Milwaukee would really benefit from adopting a more progressive stance on bike infrastructure: more bike lanes and road dieting in the right ways and places could ideally result in less reckless driving, more bike commuters, and less traffic/vehicle volume on the streets. Cars are cholesterol to city streets; we're not IN traffic, we ARE traffic. Sounds like diet and exercise are the prescriptions in both cases.

Oh and check this shit out: all ~~roads~~ bike trails in Milwaukee seem to lead to...the Couture. Gee.

#Know your laws!

###Bicycles as vehicles:
[340.01(5)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/340/01/5): Bicycles are vehicles. 
[346.02(4)(a)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/346/I/02/4/a): Bicycle operates have the same rights as motor vehicles and subject to same responsibilities of motor vehicle drivers, "except those provisions that by their express terms apply only to motor vehicles or that by their very nature would have no application to bicycles..."

###Signals:
[346.34(1)(b)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/346/V/34/1/b): Signals **ARE required** from a bike continously during at least the last 50 feet before a turn or lane change.
346.34(1)(b): Signals are **NOT required if the bicyclist decides both hands are needed on the handlebars for their own safety**. 
[346.35](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/346/V/35): Signals are required from either hand/arm. Briefly: Left turn or U-turn — Hand and arm extended horizontally. Right turn — Hand and arm extended upward. Stop or decrease speed — Hand and arm extended downward. Or I just point - breaking the law, but *can* be less ambiguous for drivers.

###Passing:
[346.075](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/346/II/075): **"The operator of a motor vehicle overtaking a bicycle, electric scooter, or electric personal assistive mobility device proceeding in the same direction shall exercise due care, leaving a safe distance, but in no case less than 3 feet clearance when passing the bicycle..., and shall maintain clearance until safely past the overtaken bicycle..."** Thankfully WI is among the [many states that require 3 feet](https://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/safely-passing-bicyclists.aspx) but shoutout to Pennsylvania at 4 feet! Not like most drivers give a shit, I'm sure. Though we should be glad to live in a [place ranked among the bike friendliest states](https://www.bikeleague.org/StateBikeLaws).

###Use of sidewalks:
[346.94(1)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/346.94(1): Vehicle operators - including bicyclists on bicycles - **"may not drive upon any sidewalk** area except at a permanent or temporarily established driveway unless permitted to do so by the local authorities."

###Bicycling at night:
[347.489(1)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/347.489(1): A **front white *light*** and **rear red *reflector* are required** on streets, paths, trails, etc. The headlight must be visible 500 feet away; the rear red reflector must be visible 50-500 feet away. Blinking rear red lights are highly recommended, and cheap, so what's your excuse. Bonus points: put your red blinker on the back of your helmet! You sit a good deal higher than your seat post, you know?

###Parking your 3-ton armor-plated living rooms with a dozen cup-holders in bike lanes:
Fucking don't. You deserve your fine or tow, asshole, and I will call 414-286-2489 (Milwaukee's 311 equivalent) to report you to the city every single time. We don't care that you just went inside for only 2 minutes, and you put your blinkers on - *bike lanes are not for parking your car.* Granted, the law is vague for *stopping* your car in a bike lane with or without blinkers, and I would argue that if you stop your running car and exit it you've parked it, but you're still breaking the law by *driving onto* the bike lane, so you know what, if you can someone magically elevate your car straight up from the driving lane, over three feet, and straight down onto the bike lane, I'll eat my hat and you can park/stop there. [346.94(12)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/346.94(12): "**No operator of a motor vehicle may drive upon a bicycle lane or bicycle way except to enter a driveway, to merge into a bicycle lane before turning at an intersection, or to enter or leave a parking space located adjacent to the bicycle lane or bicycle way.** Persons operating a motor vehicle upon a bicycle lane or bicycle way shall yield the right-of-way to all bicycles, electric scooters, and electric personal assistive mobility devices within the bicycle lane or bicycle way."

###Penalty violation for parking in the fucking bike lane:
Not enough. [346.95(1)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/346/XIII/95/1): [A]ny person violating s. ...346.94(12)...may be required to forfeit not less than $20 nor more than $40 for the first offense and not less than $50 nor more than $100 for the 2nd or subsequent conviction within a year.

###For funsies, red lights: 
[346.37(1)(c)4](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/346.37(1)(c)4): A "...bicycle facing a red signal at an intersection may, after stopping as required...**for not less than 45 seconds, proceed cautiously through the intersection before the signal turns green if no other vehicles are present** at the intersection to actuate the signal and the operator of the...bicycle reasonably believes the signal is vehicle actuated. **The operator of a ...bicycle proceeding through a red signal under this subdivision shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicular traffic, pedestrian, personal delivery device, bicyclist, or rider of an electric scooter or an electric personal assistive mobility device** proceeding through a green signal at the intersection or lawfully within a crosswalk or using the intersection..."
