**MKE-bike**  
Every bike lane & trail in Milwaukee mapped

# **About this map:**  
Layers of lanes and trails are in the top right corner. Street segments are clickable for more details. This map maps all types of on-street bike lanes and paved off-street trails. Unlike most bike maps, this one does not include *bicycle routes*, which are only marked with small, vague signs in unnoticeable places, and on bad bike maps. *Bike routes* are usually connectors between lanes and/or trails, easily intuited or completely unintuitive. Plus, when bike maps *do* show bike routes, the maps can be crazy confusing - looking at you, [City of Milwaukee](https://city.milwaukee.gov/Milwaukee-by-Bike/maps.htm#.XjyFSjNKiM8). For that matter, bike maps can be absurdly complex, like [this angel hair pasta catastrophe from Brookfield](https://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/DocumentCenter/View/1362/pedestrian_bike_path_map?bidId=). Anyway:

**Solid green lines** are on-street paved bike lanes, including:  

* [dedicated](https://city.milwaukee.gov/mpw/infrastructure/Milwaukee-by-Bike/Bike-Facilities/Bike-Lanes.htm) bike lanes are the most common (a lane with 1-2 parallel lines between moving traffic and curb, sometimes with [green paint](https://city.milwaukee.gov/mpw/infrastructure/Milwaukee-by-Bike/Bike-Facilities/Green-Bike-Lanes.htm) but usually not)

* [buffered](https://city.milwaukee.gov/mpw/infrastructure/Milwaukee-by-Bike/Bike-Facilities/Buffered-Bike-Lanes.htm) bike lanes (zebra stripes separating automotive vehicular traffic from dedicated bike lanes)  

* [protected](https://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cityBikePed/2018-Images/Locust_North_Newsletter_STAFF_APPROVED_FINAL_11_14_2018.pdf) (by a barrier, duh, like bollards, concrete, or parked cars)

* Milwaukee also has bidirectional [cycle tracks](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/cycle-tracks/raised-cycle-tracks/), raised and unraised, and Tosa has a bunch of [green bike boxes]
(https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/intersection-treatments/bike-boxes/)

* Milwaukee also has a few raised dedicated lanes, like on Bay St in Bay View, but since they're dedicated lanes that are kind of buffered but also kind of protected, I haven't marked them specially

If you're biking anywhere, prioritize the off-street trails, like the Oaf Leaf Lines. If you're biking on streets, any street with solid green lines (on this map) are your best bets. Prioritize cycle tracks (like Mayfair between Bluemound & the Hank Aaron/I-94) and concrete divider (Jersey barrier)-protected lanes over buffered lanes, over dedicated lanes, over sharrows, over nothing. Safety first.

**Fluorescent yellow-green lines** (will be dotted in the future) are used for shared bike lanes:

* [Shared driving/biking lanes](https://city.milwaukee.gov/mpw/infrastructure/Milwaukee-by-Bike/Bike-Facilities/Shared-Lane-Markings.htm) are marked on-street painted sharrows, which are [symbols of a bicyclist with two chevrons](https://www.bicycling.com/news/a20044419/what-are-sharrows-used-for/). Sharrows indicate that moving motor vehicles and bikes must share the same lane, and bikes have a clearer right-of-way. Sharrows sometimes but do not always mark official bike routes, but not all bike routes have sharrows. Bike routes and sharrows suck. Paint doesn't save lives.

* Shared parking lanes, aka Curb Lanes, are indicated by a curbside sign of a black and white diamond that may or may not also be painted on-street; bicyclists must share the lane with parked cars, and you might as well volunteer to get doored. Both are much less helpful than on-street lanes and off-street trails, but we'll take what we can get. Sometimes you'll find these diamond signs where they don't belong, like along Forest Home's dedicated bike and dedicated parking lanes - whatever. Also, some places in the County are too cheap to shell out cash for fully painted lines, and will do dumb shit like along Greenfield Ave in West Allis or Packard in Cudahy. You'll know what I mean. I decided these fall under this group.

The City's Most Likely to Get You Doored awards probably go to all of North Ave, N 16th and 17th near Marquette, Prospect & Farwell, all of Brady, and Erie St in the Third Ward. 

**Other colors** are off-street, paved bike [trails](https://city.milwaukee.gov/mpw/infrastructure/Milwaukee-by-Bike/Bike-Facilities/Trails.htm), except the [Oak Leaf Trail system](https://county.milwaukee.gov/County-Files/Parks-Department/Photo-Gallery/Explore/Trails/OLT-System-map-0619.pdf)'s so called *Lines* (e.g. "Zip Line," "South Shore Line," etc.) are color-matched to the County Parks' map. But because we're so lucky to have so, so many off-street paved bike trails in Milwaukee County, I kind of ran out of colors to label them all. I welcome any feedback from those with visual impairments or map colorists so we can find some better colorways for these layers than hues like ochre, puke, etc.

Call **Milwaukee's 311 equivalent 414-286-2489** to report idiots' cars parked/stopped in bike lanes, obstructions in bike lanes, etc.
